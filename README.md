# Lizzis Retail Manager

I'm building this management system for my future custom makeover and styling studio - InHerElement. The purpose of this project is to build a reusable management software using best practices and clean code besides revisiting/learning advanced ASP.NET, and C# topics in depth. I'm primarily following Mr. Tim Corey's Retail Manager course, and customizing on top of it to fit my business's requirements.
